# Output Directory Migration Summary

## ✅ Successfully Updated All Files to Use `output/` Directory

### Changes Made:

### 1. **coupon-mos.ts**:
- ✅ Added `import * as path from "path"`
- ✅ Created `output/` directory if it doesn't exist with `fs.mkdirSync('output', { recursive: true })`
- ✅ Updated directory path to use `path.join(outputDir, 'coupon_mos_pos_number-e2e-${total}')`
- ✅ Updated file paths to use `path.join(targetDir, '${filePrefix}${i + 1}.csv')`
- ✅ Fixed global variable issue by moving `allCodes` into the function scope

### 2. **general_16.ts**:
- ✅ Added `import * as path from "path"`
- ✅ Created `output/` directory if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Updated directory path to use `path.join(outputDir, 'general_number-e2e-${totalCodes}-rows')`
- ✅ Updated file paths to use `path.join(targetDir, 'codes_${i + 1}.csv')`
- ✅ Encapsulated logic in `generateUniqueCodes()` function to avoid global variable issues
- ✅ Fixed variable naming conflict with `path` module

### 3. **pos12.ts**:
- ✅ Added `import * as path from "path"`
- ✅ Created `output/` directory if it doesn't exist
- ✅ Updated directory path to use `path.join(outputDir, 'coupon_kfc_pos_number-e2e-${total}-rows')`
- ✅ Updated file paths to use `path.join(targetDir, 'unit_codes_total_${total}_${i}.csv')`

### 4. **deleted-csv.ts**:
- ✅ Updated to recursively search for CSV files in both current directory and `output/` directory
- ✅ Added proper error handling and counting of deleted files
- ✅ Enhanced with detailed logging of deleted file paths
- ✅ Function now reports total number of files deleted or if no files were found

### 5. **index.ts**:
- ✅ Updated description for `deleted-csv` script to reflect new behavior

## Directory Structure:

All generated files now follow this pattern:
```
output/
├── coupon_mos_pos_number-e2e-{total}/
│   ├── coupon_mos_1.csv
│   ├── coupon_mos_2.csv
│   └── ...
├── general_number-e2e-{totalCodes}-rows/
│   ├── codes_1.csv
│   ├── codes_2.csv
│   └── ...
└── coupon_kfc_pos_number-e2e-{total}-rows/
    ├── unit_codes_total_{total}_1.csv
    ├── unit_codes_total_{total}_2.csv
    └── ...
```

## Key Improvements:

1. **Centralized Output**: All generated files now go to `output/` directory instead of cluttering the working directory
2. **Proper Path Handling**: Using `path.join()` for cross-platform compatibility
3. **Directory Creation**: Automatic creation of `output/` directory and subdirectories as needed
4. **Error Prevention**: Fixed global variable issues that could cause problems on repeated runs
5. **Enhanced Cleanup**: CSV deletion script now finds and removes files recursively
6. **Preserved Logic**: All existing generation logic and error handling remains intact

## Usage:

All existing npm scripts work exactly the same:
- `npm run coupon-mos` - Generates MOS format coupons in `output/coupon_mos_pos_number-e2e-1000000/`
- `npm run general-16` - Generates 16-digit codes in `output/general_number-e2e-100000-rows/`
- `npm run pos12` - Generates POS codes in `output/coupon_kfc_pos_number-e2e-1000000-rows/`
- `npm run deleted-csv` - Recursively deletes all CSV files in current and output directories

Files are now organized and contained within the `output/` directory, making project management cleaner and more predictable.
